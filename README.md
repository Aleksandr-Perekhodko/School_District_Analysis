# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
In the followiung project we created in Jupyter Notebook project using Pandas, we used excel sheets to pull data out of and use it for the following project. It had School District type, budget, and size. Then the another of the excel shet we pulled data from had Students names, grades for reading and math grade and school. In the challange there is a cleaned up version for school district metric and from the original code there is a original version fo the school district metrics. In the challange we used the data from the excel sheets to create a new school summary for Thomas High School that only shows the perfromance level of the grades levels between 10th to 12th.

The Differences between the two data frames are very minimal they are almost basically the same. There is a ver low percentage difference. For example the overall percentage difference between the original and clean is about a 0.2% difference.

Comparing the Clean data to the original data there is quite a difference. The clean data and the original datas math and reading score are very similiar with math scores having a difference of 0.7% and reading scores having a difference of clean data to original data of 0.05%. But there is quite a difference for clean data and the original data for % passing in reading, math, and overall passing. Again the difference between the orginal data and clean data for Thomas High School is the Original data still has ninth graders in the data frame while the clean data only has tenth to twelfth graders in the data frame. The difference between clean data and original data for % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing is as follows. % Passing Math, -26.36%; % Passing Reading, -27.64%; % Overall Passing, -25.87%. That is quite a difference with not having ninth graders in the data frame.
